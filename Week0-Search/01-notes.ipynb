    "## Search Algorithms\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Depth-First Search (DFS) 📊\n",
    "\n",
    "**Strategy**: Go as deep as possible in one direction before trying others\n",

    "```python\n",
    "def remove(self):\n",
    "    if self.empty():\n",
    "        raise Exception(\"empty frontier\")\n",

    "        raise Exception(\"empty frontier\")\n",
    "    else:\n",
    "        # Remove first item (oldest node)\n",
    "        node = self.frontier[0]\n",
    "        self.frontier = self.frontier[1:]\n",
    "        return node\n",

    "- **h(n)**: Estimated cost from current location to goal\n",
    "\n",
    "**Formula**: f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Advantage**: More accurate cost determination, prevents going down inefficient paths\n",
    "\n",
    "**Requirements for Optimality**:\n",
